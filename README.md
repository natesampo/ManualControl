HOW TO PLAY:

Your factory's AI has crashed! You must gradually take manual control over each production facility, otherwise the entire system will collapse!

The boxes in the top-left corner control each factory of that type. The boxes are controlled using the 1-4 number buttons. Press the corresponding number when the box reaches the white line to score a point and produce an idea. Missing a box, or hitting the button at the wrong time causes a malfunction in your factory production and causes you to lose a health point for each factory damaged. If your health points reach 0, you lose! At the end of each level your remaining health is added to your score as a bonus and your health resets to 100.
